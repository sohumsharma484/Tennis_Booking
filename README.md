Automatically books the Canyon Creek HOA tennis courts

First, the bookTennis.py file is run to schedule the tennis automation program to run as soon as the courts open for reservation. It uses the windows scheduler to run a batch file at the desired time, which runs the tennisAutomation.py file with all arguments (such as court and time) passed and actually books the court. This program is built to run on my computer and would need to be modified to run elsewhere.

*Note: due to a change of system to book CC courts, this application no longer works.
